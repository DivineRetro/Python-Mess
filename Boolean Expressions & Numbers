# Write a program to create boolean expressions for each of the comparisons listed below. For this program you will be working with four integer variables x, y, z and w. Get these numbers as input from the user and convert them to integers before storing them in the corresponding variables. 
x = int(input("Enter a number as 'x': "))
y = int(input("Enter a number as 'y': "))
z = int(input("Enter a number as 'z': "))
w = int(input("Enter a number as 'w': "))
# 1. boolean expression to evaluate if (x+y) is greater than (z+w)
xy = (x + y)
zw = (z + w)
print("(" + str(x), "+", str(y) + ") > (" + str(z), "+", str(w) + "):", xy > zw)
# 2. boolean expression to evaluate if x is greater than y
print(x, ">", y, ":", x > y)
# 3. boolean expression to evaluate if y is greater than z
print(y, ">", z, ":", y > z)
# 4. boolean expression to evaluate if (x * y ) is less than (z * w)
xy = (x * y)
zw = (z * w)
print("(" + str(x), "*", str(y) + ") < (" + str(z), "*", str(w) + "):", xy < zw)
# 5. boolean expression to evaluate if x and y are equal
print(x, "==", y, ":", x == y)
# 6. boolean expression to evaluate if z and w are equal
print(z, "==", w, ":", z == w)
# 7. boolean expression to evaluate if z and w are NOT equal
print(z, "!=", w, ":", z != w)
# 8. boolean expression to evaluate if x and y are NOT equal
print(x, "!=", y, ":", x != y)
# 9. boolean expression to evaluate if x is greater than or equal to y
print(x, ">=", y, ":", x >= y)
# 10. boolean expression to evaluate if z is less than or equal to w 
print(z, "<=", w, ":", z <= w)
# Print the expressions and their results using print statements.
